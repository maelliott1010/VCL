    " There are several easy ways to [get jupyter notebook/labs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). The easiest and recommended way is by downloading the Anaconda installation which has Python, Jupyter notebooks and other important and useful packages bundled into one. \n",
    "\n",

    " ## The Basic Anatomy of a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    " \n",
    " In a Jupyter notebook, a **cell** is a box where you can place either code or text. A code cell is where you can put code to be run by the notebook's kernel and a text cell is where you can format text using markdown to be displayed when the cell is run. The **kernel** is what executes the code that is written in the code cells and is applied to the entire notebook, this means that you can do things like import packages and define functions in one cell and you can use them in another. The kernel for this notebook is for Python but there are lots of other kernels for other languages such as Java and R."
